## How It Works

The application uses a modular approach where each content section is stored in a separate HTML file. When a user navigates to a section, the content is loaded dynamically into the main page. This approach offers several benefits:

1. **Easier Maintenance**: Content can be updated independently
2. **Faster Loading**: Only the required content is loaded
3. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of concerns
4. **Simplified Development**: Multiple team members can work on different modules

## Setup Instructions

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. No build process required - this is a static site
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site
4. For local testing with proper module loading, use a local server:
   - With Python: `python -m http.server`
   - With Node.js: `npx serve`

### Deployment

The site can be deployed to any static hosting service:

1. Upload all files maintaining the folder structure
2. Ensure server is configured to serve the proper MIME types
3. No server-side processing is required

## Future Enhancements

- **User Accounts**: Allow users to track their progress
- **Interactive Assessments**: Add quizzes to test knowledge
- **Download Manager**: Implement actual file downloads
- **Video Tutorials**: Add embedded video content
- **Search Functionality**: Allow users to search across all content
