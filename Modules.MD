# Excel Templates - Modules Structure Documentation

## Overview
The Excel Templates application uses a modular content structure where each module is stored as a separate HTML file. These modules are loaded dynamically into the main page when requested by the user. This approach allows for better organization, easier content updates, and improved performance.

## File Structure

```

## Module Loading System

The application uses a dynamic content loading system:
1. User selects a module via navigation
2. JavaScript loads the requested HTML module via fetch API
3. Content is inserted into the main container
4. Additional scripts initialize interactive elements
5. Progress is tracked in the user's browser storage

## Content Guidelines

1. **Topic Organization**:
   - Each module is divided into logical topic cards
   - Topics include both theory and practical examples
   - Code snippets and sample formulas are formatted consistently
   - Topics progress from basic to more advanced concepts

2. **Interactive Elements**:
   - Practice exercises at the end of modules
   - Downloadable resources for hands-on practice
   - "Try it yourself" challenges
   - Interactive formula examples where appropriate

3. **Visual Aids**:
   - Screenshots for interface references
   - Diagrams for complex concepts
   - Table examples for formula results
   - Icons for visual categorization

4. **Cross-Referencing**:
   - Related topics section links to relevant content
   - Learning path integration guides users between modules
   - Prerequisites noted where applicable

## Extending the Module System

To add a new module:

1. Create a new HTML file in the modules directory
2. Follow the established content structure pattern
3. Add the module to the navigation in index.html
4. Add appropriate module references in the learning path
5. Update the moduleDisplayNames object in script.js

This modular approach allows for easy expansion of the content library without requiring changes to the core application structure.
